# Description
As I’ve been building my SQL skills, I’ve worked on projects focused on the fundamentals of database management. These projects involved writing queries to retrieve and manipulate data using **joins**, **subqueries**, and **aggregate functions**. By getting hands-on with these exercises, I’ve built a strong foundation in working with databases and am looking forward to taking on more advanced data tasks as I grow in my career.
You can find the queries I wrote in the `scripts.sql` file, along with the database that was used.
